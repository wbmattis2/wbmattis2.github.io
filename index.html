				Born and raised in <a href="http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/01/31/statistically_townsend_just_your_average_mass_town/" title="News article about Townsend, MA" target="_blank">an average Massachusetts town</a>, I went to UMASS Amherst before  traveling across the country for several years of full-time domestic volunteer service. The indispensability of  technology for volunteer recruitment inspired me to pursue a career in web design and development.  Other interests of mine include  philosophy (reading and writing), exercise (walking and weightlifting), movies, and game design.

				This corner of cyberspace was created primarily to serve as an ePortfolio of my work in software engineering and web development. A few of my recent projects can be found under the "Projects" section. There is also a Resume page for a general outline of the roles I've filled over the years, as well as a "Links" page with a few of my most frequently visited destinations on the web. The "Coursework" page goes into more detail about some of the courses I've enrolled in.
