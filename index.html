				This corner of cyberspace was created primarily to serve as an ePortfolio of my work in software engineering and web development. A few of my recent projects can be found under the "Projects" section. There is also a Resume page for a general outline of the roles I've filled over the years, as well as a "Links" page with a few of my most frequently visited destinations on the web. The "Coursework" page goes into more detail about some of the courses I've enrolled in.
