		<h1>About Me ("Benny" Wayne Mattis)</h1>
		<section class="flex-col-container">
			<div class="col-wrapper">
				<p class="align-right solid-bg">
				Born and raised in <a href="http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/01/31/statistically_townsend_just_your_average_mass_town/" title="News article about Townsend, MA" target="_blank">Townsend, Massachusetts</a>, I bring years of experience in customer service, disaster relief, food access, fundraising, volunteer recruitment, and analytic philosophy to my work as a technical consultant and game designer. My interests lie primarily in nonprofits and small business: I aim to leverage automation, integration, and data-driven strategy to increase organizational impact, and I aim to design and develop interactive stories which challenge players to see the world in a new light. When I'm not working or learning new tools, some of my other pastimes include walking, weightlifting, meditating, and movie-watching.

				    This corner of cyberspace was created to function as a general introduction to myself and my work. I designed and developed its code from the ground up with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this "cyber-space-suit" image in Adobe Photoshop by combining an image of myself with <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/amF7lbfzLj0" target="_blank" title="Photo by Bradley Dunn on Unsplash">a freely available astronaut image</a>. The <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/c9OCWLka764" target="_blank" title="Photo by Max McKinnon on Unsplash">background image</a> is another free resource that I altered in Photoshop and the Gnu Image Manipulation Program; feel free to observe it by clicking the "stargazing" button at the bottom-left of your screen, but watch out for space debris! Speaking of space debris, this site's sound effect is from <a href="https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/distant-explosion-80398/" target="_blank" title="Sound effect on Pixabay">Pixabay</a>. Thanks for stopping by!
