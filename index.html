		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<section class="flex-col-container">
			<div class="col-wrapper">
				<p class="align-right solid-bg">
					Welcome!<br/><br/> In my work as a web developer and IT consultant, I bring years of experience in the social sector to locate and implement solutions primarily for nonprofit clients. As an independent game developer and scholar of philosophy, I aspire to design and develop interactive games that provide a fun challenge while shedding some light on philosophical themes and questions.

Feel free to read some examples of my writing, web development coding examples, or games that I have developed by clicking the links in this site's header.
