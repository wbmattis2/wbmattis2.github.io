		<h1>About</h1>

				Born and raised in <a href="http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/01/31/statistically_townsend_just_your_average_mass_town/" title="News article about Townsend, MA" target="_blank">Townsend, Massachusetts</a>, I attended UMASS Amherst before  traveling across the country for several years of full-time domestic volunteer service. The indispensability of  technology for volunteer recruitment inspired me to pursue a career in web development and digital marketing.  My other interests include  philosophy (reading and writing), exercise (walking and weightlifting), movies, and game design.

				    I designed and coded this corner of cyberspace to showcase some of my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also created the "cyber-space-suit" image in Adobe Photoshop by combining an image of myself with <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/amF7lbfzLj0" target="_blank" title="Photo by Bradley Dunn on Unsplash">a freely available astronaut image</a>. The <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/c9OCWLka764" target="_blank" title="Photo by Max McKinnon on Unsplash">background image</a> is another free resource that I altered in Photoshop for this website. Don't forget to take a few moments to gaze into the dim green light of a virtual sky!
