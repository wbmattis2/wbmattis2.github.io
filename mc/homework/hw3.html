    <h2>Five Things You Should Know About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I once completed a talent assessment called the <a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/254033/strengthsfinder.aspx" title="CliftonStrengths website" target="_blank">Clifton StrengthsFinder 2.0</a>.
        I found that my assessment results did help me understand my own strengths and personality.
        If you'd like to get a better sense of my talents, take a look at my reflections on the assessment below!
        The results focused primarily on an exploration of my "Top 5 Themes":
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#futuristic" title="">Futuristic</a></li>
        <li><a href="#intellection" title="">Intellection</a></li>
        <li><a href="#connectedness" title="">Connectedness</a></li>
        <li><a href="#relator" title="">Relator</a></li>
        <li><a href="#adaptability" title="">Adaptability</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="futuristic">Futuristic</h3>
        <p>
            I would say that I am primarily motivated by my dreams of the future.
            Growing up as an only child, I had ample opportunity to exercise my imagination in various contexts.
            Now, I am motivated toward personal achievement by dreams of what my life could be like if I made the right decisions.
            I find that it helps me to make an effort every day to intentionally focus on the present, without getting lost in my dreams.
            In professional settings, I leverage this strength in my favor by imagining new ways processes might be optimized in the future.
        </p>
    <h3 id="intellection">Intellection</h3>
        <p>
            Intellection is another strength that thrives on the imagination.
            I have continued to study and write about philosophy long after graduating college, because I enjoy thinking about new ideas and participating in discussions that push me to the limit of my understanding.
            To avoid letting this virtue become a vice, I make an effort to engage regularly in meditation and physical exercise, which sometimes help to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-empowerment-diary/201709/calming-the-monkey-mind" title="Psychology Today article" target="_blank">calm the "monkey mind."</a>
            In professional settings, this strength helps me to analyze processes in order to improve on them or communicate about them to other stakeholders.
        </p>
    <h3 id="connectedness">Connectedness</h3>
        <p>
            The third of my top "themes" is connectedness, indicating that I tend to see everything as interconnected.
            I think this is an accurate description of me; I do think that I have an ability and tendency to look at the big picture and see how ripples can make big differences down the line.
            At one time, this manifested in my life as an approximately six-year-long commitment to vegetarianism.
            In professional settings, this characteristic enables me to find deeper meaning and significance in what otherwise might seem menial or insignificant tasks.
        </p>
    <h3 id="relator">Relator</h3>
        <p>
            I believe that my role as a "relator" is closely connected to my characteristic of "connectedness," in that a perspective of interconnectedness motivates me to learn from others and cooperate with others in service of shared goals.
            My consumption of various forms of media, from books to movies to music to video games, is fueled by the ways in which art can help people express themselves and thereby relate to one another.
            I believe that this theme also pertains to the years of full-time volunteer service I have completed in AmeriCorps and similar programs; I seek out opportunities to work with others in order to pursue a shared goal.
            Professionally, being a relator helps me to work with others toward an ideal, possibly counteracting some of the risks of aloofness associated with the "Futuristic" and "Intellection" themes.
        </p>
    <h3 id="adaptability">Adaptability</h3>
        <p>
            Adaptability is another characteristic which has proved particularly relevant in my years of service, as they have allowed me to enter a diverse range of roles across different regions within the US, sometimes while living in community with other volunteers.
            I do not always or entirely "go with the flow," but I find that it is important to pick one's battles, and that working with the current can be more productive than fighting it head-on.
            In order to avoid the excesses of adaptability, I sometimes need to remind myself of the importance of self-assertion for the cultivation of sustainable relationships.
            In professional settings, my adaptability proves helpful in enabling me to think outside of the box, procedurally and socially, when things do not go as initially planned.
